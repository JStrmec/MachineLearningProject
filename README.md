Project Proposal:
Our project is to build a convolutional neural network using keras. Our data which is composed of hashcodes of malware files, API calls from PEFile library in Python, and the malware type from the VirusTotal API, in CSV format. One of these datasets contains 9,795 samples obtained and compiled from VirusSamples.

VirusSample dataset includes the malware families of 1. Adware, 2. Agent, 3. Backdoor, 4. Trojan, 5. Virus, 6. Worms, 7. Downloader, 8. Spyware, 9. Ransomware, 10. Riskware, 11. Dropper, 12. Crypt, 13. Keylogger. 

VirusShare dataset includes families of Adware, Agent, Backdoor, Downloader, Ransomware, Riskware, Trojan, Virus, Worms, Undefined, Spyware, Dropper, Crypt, Keylogger, Rootkit. 

*Run Instructions*
In a code editor that allows python, the most recent version if possible, open showcase.ipynb and run. Or results can be viewed in showcase.html.
